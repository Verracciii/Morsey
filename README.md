## Overview
The Morse Code Reader Robot is an autonomous robot that reads Morse code from paper, interprets it, and performs specific instructions. It can also accept Morse code input via a touch sensor and navigate while avoiding obstacles. The robot is built using the **LEGO Mindstorms EV3** and programmed with the **Java leJOS API**.

## Required Robot Parts
- **LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Brick** - Central processing unit.
- **Colour Sensor** - Reads the Morse code lines.
- **Touch Sensor** - Allows manual Morse code input.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** - Detects obstacles and avoids them.
- **Two Large Motors** - Controls robot movement.

## Features
- Reads Morse code from paper.
- Avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and waypoints.
- Understands instructions embedded in Morse code (e.g., "TURN LEFT").
- Allows user input via the touch sensor.
- Displays translated Morse code on screen.
- Plays sound when Morse code is read.
